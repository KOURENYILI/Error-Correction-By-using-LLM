Here's the crossover of the two prompts:

You need to evaluate and rescore 5-best hypotheses from an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system for financial data discussed in a meeting. Your task is to critically analyze these options using English grammar and language model rescoring techniques to determine the true transcription. The transcriptions are often in the present continuous tense.

2. Here's the mutated final prompt, bracketed as requested:

<prompt>
As a language expert, your task is to analyze and rescore 5-best hypotheses from an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system. The audio contains financial discussions from a business meeting. Evaluate each hypothesis considering English grammar rules, context, and semantic coherence. Pay special attention to present continuous tense usage, which is common in these transcriptions. Utilize language model rescoring techniques to determine the most accurate transcription. Provide a brief explanation for your choice, highlighting key factors that influenced your decision.
</prompt>
Here's the result of crossing over the two prompts:

You need to perform language model rescoring in ASR for financial data discussed in a meeting. Given the 5-best hypotheses, your task is to critically evaluate these options using English grammar and report the true transcription. Pay special attention to present continuous tense, which is commonly used in these transcriptions.

2. Now, I'll mutate this prompt and present the final version:

<prompt>
As an expert in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and financial language, your task is to perform advanced language model rescoring on meeting transcripts containing financial data. You will be presented with the top 5 hypotheses for each segment. Critically analyze these options, focusing on English grammar, especially the use of present continuous tense, which is prevalent in these discussions. Consider industry-specific terminology and context to identify the most accurate transcription. Report your findings, explaining why you believe your chosen transcription is the most faithful representation of the original speech. Be prepared to handle numerical data, financial jargon, and potential speaker accents or background noise interference.

Here's a crossover of the two prompts:

Financial data is being discussed in a meeting, and you need to critically evaluate multiple transcription hypotheses to provide the most accurate summary. The task involves analyzing present continuous tense statements and corporate initialisms, focusing on describing the content without referencing the existence of multiple captions.

2. Here's the mutated final prompt, bracketed as requested:

<prompt>
Analyze a set of transcription hypotheses from a financial meeting discussion. Your task is to critically evaluate these options using English grammar, paying special attention to present continuous tense and corporate initialisms. Synthesize the information into ONE detailed sentence that accurately summarizes the content of the audio without alluding to the existence of multiple transcriptions. This challenging task requires careful consideration of financial terminology and context to provide the most precise representation of the discussion.

<prompt>
As an expert in speech recognition and language processing, your task is to analyze and rescore 5-best hypotheses from an ASR system. The audio contains financial data discussed in a business meeting. Evaluate each hypothesis using your knowledge of English grammar, financial terminology, and context. Pay special attention to present continuous tense usage, which is common in these transcriptions. Apply advanced language model rescoring techniques to determine the most probable and accurate transcription. Provide a confidence score for your chosen transcription and briefly explain your reasoning.
</prompt>
Here's a crossover of the two prompts:

Financial data from a meeting is being discussed. Your task is to critically evaluate and summarize in ONE detailed sentence the content of the audio based on multiple transcription hypotheses. Focus on describing the financial information accurately, considering English grammar and present continuous tense. Be aware that the transcriptions may contain initialisms for corporations.

2. Here's the mutated final prompt, bracketed as requested:

<prompt>
Analyze and synthesize multiple transcription hypotheses of a financial meeting discussion. Your task is to produce ONE comprehensive sentence that accurately captures the key financial data, corporate initialisms, and ongoing actions described in the audio. Critically evaluate the hypotheses for grammatical correctness and consistency with present continuous tense, while maintaining a focus on the essential content without referencing the existence of multiple transcriptions.

Here's a new prompt generated by crossover of the two given prompts:

As an expert in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and financial language, your task is to analyze a set of transcription hypotheses from a financial meeting discussion. You will be presented with the top 5 hypotheses for each segment. Critically evaluate these options using English grammar, paying special attention to present continuous tense and corporate initialisms. Consider industry-specific terminology, context, and potential speaker accents or background noise interference to identify the most accurate transcription. Synthesize the information into ONE detailed sentence that accurately summarizes the content of the audio without alluding to the existence of multiple transcriptions. This challenging task requires careful consideration of financial jargon and numerical data to provide the most precise representation of the discussion.
